### Accomplished Today
- **Set up basic Godot project** - First time using Godot, coming from Unity background
- **Created player controller** - CharacterBody3D capsule with WASD movement in 4 directions
- **Implemented camera system** - Attached camera to player with semi-top-down perspective (targeting the Hades-style tilted view)
- **Basic scene setup** - Player capsule on a ground plane, functional movement
### Technical Progress
- Learned Godot's node-based architecture vs Unity's GameObject system
- Successfully implemented basic 3D movement controls
- Camera positioning established for the intended perspective
### Resources Used
- **Tutorial:** [Godot 4 - How to make a 3D Character Controller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVsn9NqpVhg)
### Next Session Goals
- Add a basic enemy
- Make it move towards the player object
- Detect collisions between them
