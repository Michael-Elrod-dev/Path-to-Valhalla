- **Created save/load game state architecture** - Built complete save state manager system enabling persistent game progress storage and retrieval, allowing players to save current position, health, and level progress
- **Integrated pause menu UI components** - Developed pause menu interface with save game, load game, and resume functionality using Control node hierarchies and proper UI input handling
### Technical Progress
- Applied get_tree().paused property manipulation for complete game state suspension while maintaining UI responsiveness
- Learned process_mode configuration for UI elements to function during paused game states
- Implemented file I/O operations for save game data persistence using Godot's file system API
- Built save state data structure management for player position, health, current scene, and game progress variables
- Mastered Control node UI development with proper button signal connections and menu navigation
### Current Architecture State
- Complete pause system with game state suspension and professional menu overlay
- Persistent save/load functionality preserving player progress across game sessions
- UI system architecture ready for expansion with additional menu options and game settings
- Input management system supporting pause functionality integrated with existing player controls
- Save state manager foundation prepared for complex game data serialization and progression tracking
