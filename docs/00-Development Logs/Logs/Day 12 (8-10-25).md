### Accomplished Today
- **Implemented enemy chase state system** - Added new chase state as default enemy behavior enabling 360-degree directional movement toward player, replacing previous 8-directional constraint system
- **Enhanced player attack mechanics** - Modified player attack system to target mouse cursor direction instead of player facing direction
- **Created dynamic enemy spawn system** - Built configurable enemy spawner with customizable parameters including maximum enemies alive simultaneously, total enemies per level, and spawn rate timing, working alongside existing manually placed enemies
- **2D Pixel Artist** - Did some searching on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/)for a more professional artist for the game and followed a few. Sent a message to [Zac](https://www.artstation.com/sneb)
### Resources Used
- None
### Next Session Goals
- Refine enemy chase behavior with pathfinding improvements and obstacle avoidance
- Consider making player sprite face the direction of the mouse regardless of walking direction
- Refactor code to comply with the official [Godot style guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/4.4/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_styleguide.html)
