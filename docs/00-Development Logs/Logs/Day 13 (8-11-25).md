### Accomplished Today
- **Docs Update** - Filled out the details for most most of the first levels art direction including the enemies, environment, and the basic starter weapons the player can choose from
- **Pixel Artists** - Found a lot of pixel artists on [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/) and reached out to quite a few for character sprites and maybe 2 for environments
### Resources Used
- Brainstormed with Claude and pulled images from google for design references
### Next Session Goals
- Refine enemy chase behavior with pathfinding improvements and obstacle avoidance
- Consider making player sprite face the direction of the mouse regardless of walking direction
