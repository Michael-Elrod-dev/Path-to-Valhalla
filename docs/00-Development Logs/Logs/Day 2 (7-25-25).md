### Accomplished Today
- **Solved critical physics performance bug** - Migrated from default Godot Physics to Jolt Physics, eliminating 1 FPS collision lag
- **Implemented combat system** - Player health (100 HP), enemy damage (10 per hit), simple game over/restart functionality
- **Built dynamic enemy spawning** - Enemies spawn every 2 seconds at random positions around player
- **Converted player to CharacterBody3D** - Replaced RigidBody3D force-based movement with velocity-based control
- **Set up collision layer system** - Organized layers for Environment, Player, EnemyMovement, and EnemyDamage
- **Created dual-collision enemy system** - CharacterBody3D for physics + Area3D for damage detection
### Technical Progress
- Learned collision layers/masks for performance optimization
- Implemented signal-based communication between spawner and enemies
- Fine-tuned Jolt Physics parameters (Penetration Slop, Baumgarte)
- Added distance-based collision optimization for enemy clusters
### Performance Improvements
- **Before**: 1 FPS with 2 colliding entities
- **After**: 60 FPS with 10+ spawning enemies
- System may be ready for 100+ enemies
