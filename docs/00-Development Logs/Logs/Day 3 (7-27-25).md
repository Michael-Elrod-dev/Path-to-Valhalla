## Major Design Pivot
- **Switched from 3D/2D to Pure 2D Development** - After researching [Hyper Light Drifter's](https://store.steampowered.com/app/257850/Hyper_Light_Drifter/) visual style, made the strategic decision to abandon the 3D tilted perspective approach in favor of a pure 2D pixel art style inspired by HLD. This change dramatically simplifies development while still achieving the atmospheric visual depth I want through layering and lighting effects rather than 3D geometry.
- **Updated Project Vision** - Maintained core Vampire Survivors-inspired gameplay mechanics (boss-gated weapon progression, AI adaptive difficulty, environmental pickups) while shifting all visual presentation to match Hyper Light Drifter's beautiful pixel art aesthetic with vibrant colors and atmospheric lighting.
## Technical Progress
**Worked through some of [Godot 2D Character Controller Tutorial Series**](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&si=m6AtfLh0F56pboS-) - Followed first 3 videos covering foundational 2D character development:
### Video 1: Basic Character Setup
- Set up new Godot 4 project for 2D development
- Created simple character movement controller
- Established basic project structure
### Video 2: Animation & Directional Movement
- Implemented AnimationPlayer system for character animations
- Added directional facing based on movement input
- Set up walk and idle animation states
- Integrated Sprite2D node for character rendering
### Video 3: Finite State Machine Architecture
- Refactored simple movement code into professional state machine pattern
- Created dedicated State classes for Idle and Walk behaviors
- Built extensible PlayerStateMachine system for future combat states
- Improved code organization for serious development
## Asset Acquisition & Integration
- **Character Art** - Downloaded and integrated [Viking axe warrior sprite pack](https://sanctumpixel.itch.io/viking-axe-pixel-art-character) from Sanctum Pixel, for a placeholder
- **Environment Placeholder Assets** - Acquired basic [top-down tile sets](https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic) for future tile set placeholder
- **Sprite Sheet Creation** - Used online [sprite sheet generator](https://codeshack.io/images-sprite-sheet-generator/) to convert individual PNG animations into efficient sprite sheets for Godot import
- **Potential Artist Collaboration** - Discovered incredible pixel art animator on Reddit [ghost-pix](https://www.reddit.com/user/ghost-pix/submitted/)whose work quality matches the Hyper Light Drifter visual goals. Reached out for potential collaboration on final game art assets - awaiting response.

## Next Session Goals
- Implement basic melee weapon system (axe slash)
- Add enemy health system so they can be destroyed by weapons
- Test weapon attack timing and feel with current state machine architecture
