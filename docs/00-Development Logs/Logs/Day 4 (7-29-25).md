### Accomplished Today

- **Learned Godot tile map system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 4: Create a Player Attack State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSlXYs5dw4&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=5) focusing on tile map layers and collision architecture
- **Implemented environment collision detection** - Set up proper TileMap layers with collision shapes for physics interaction
- **Organized collision layer system** - Advanced collision mask/layer management separating environment, player, and future enemy collision detection
- **Integrated tile-based environments** - Successfully combined tile map system with existing CharacterBody2D movement controller

### Technical Progress

- Learned TileMap layer organization and collision shape integration
- Mastered collision layer separation for performance optimization
- Applied collision knowledge to environment boundaries and physics interaction
- Built foundation for efficient multi-entity collision detection (crucial for enemy swarms)

### Asset Integration

- Used previously acquired [Pixel Art Top-Down Basic tile set](https://cainos.itch.io/pixel-art-top-down-basic) for collision testing and environment layout experiments

### Current Architecture State

- Professional 2D character controller with state machine
- Complete animation system with directional movement
- Tile map system with proper collision detection
- Organized collision layers ready for combat implementation

### Resources Used

- **Tutorial**: [Create a Player Attack State - E05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSlXYs5dw4&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=5)

### Next Session Goals

- Implement Player Attack State in the state machine
- Create weapon collision detection using today's collision system knowledge
- Add basic enemy that can be damaged by player attacks
- Test combat timing and animation flow
