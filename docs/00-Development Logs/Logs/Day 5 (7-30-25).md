### Accomplished Today
- **Implemented Player Attack State** - Completed [Tutorial Video 5: Create a Player Attack State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSlXYs5dw4&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=5) adding full combat functionality to the state machine
- **Created attack animation system** - Integrated axe slash animations with proper timing and visual feedback
- **Added audio system** - Implemented AudioStreamPlayer for attack sound effects, bringing combat to life
- **Enhanced visual effects** - Used sprite modulation and layering techniques for attack feedback
- **Mastered signal architecture** - Learned Godot's signal system for clean communication between animation events and game logic
### Technical Progress
- Extended state machine with Attack state class following established architecture patterns
- Learned sprite layer management for visual effect organization
- Implemented audio integration with proper timing synchronization to animations
- Applied modulate properties for dynamic visual feedback during combat actions
- Used signals for event-driven programming between animation completion and state transitions
### Asset Integration
- Utilized axe attack animations from previously acquired [Viking axe warrior sprite pack](https://sanctumpixel.itch.io/viking-axe-pixel-art-character)
- Integrated attack sound effects into the audio system architecture
### Current Architecture State
- Complete 2D character controller with Idle, Walk, and Attack states
- Professional animation system with directional movement and combat animations
- Audio system ready for expansion with multiple sound effects
- Signal-based communication system for clean, maintainable code architecture
- Foundation prepared for hit/hurt box implementation
