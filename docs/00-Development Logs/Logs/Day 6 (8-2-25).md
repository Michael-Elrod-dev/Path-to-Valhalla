### Accomplished Today

- **Implemented combat collision detection system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 6: Add Hit and Hurt Boxes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6o8vEuqI6Q&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=7) adding hitboxes to player attacks and hurtboxes to damage-receiving objects
- **Added dynamic camera boundary system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 8: Camera Limits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQ9XreEyn6U&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=9) implementing automatic camera bounds based on tilemap dimensions for any level size
- **Created basic enemy AI system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 9: Enemy Character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLzmZPNJNDk&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=9) building enemy state machine with randomized idle/walking behavior patterns
- **Upgraded character sprite system** - Replaced 4-directional character sprites with 8-directional movement sprites, updated player controller scripts to support full 8-direction animation system
- **Established version control** - Created GitHub repository for project management and code backup

### Technical Progress

- Area2D hitbox/hurtbox collision detection for combat interactions
- Learned dynamic camera boundary calculation using tilemap get_used_rect() for scalable level design
- Built extensible enemy state machine architecture following established player state patterns
- Implemented 8-directional sprite animation system with proper direction calculation
- Applied random timer-based AI state switching for basic enemy behavior

### Asset Integration

- **New Character Sprites**: Acquired and integrated 8-directional character sprite pack replacing previous 4-directional assets
- Updated animation system to support full 8-directional movement (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW)

### Current Architecture State

- Complete combat system with hitbox/hurtbox collision detection
- Dynamic camera system that adapts to any tilemap size automatically
- Basic enemy AI with state machine architecture ready for expansion
- 8-directional character movement system for smooth directional gameplay
- Version-controlled project repository for collaborative development
