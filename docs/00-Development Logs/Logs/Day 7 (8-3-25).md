### Accomplished Today

- **Created enemy combat system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 10: Enemy Stun and Destroy States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OiOIr1ZApzk&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=10) implementing placeholder slime enemy with full state machine including Stun and Destroy states for combat interactions
- **Implemented player damage system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 11: Player Stun State](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXojXbpdMyE&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=11) adding player Stun state with knockback mechanics and damage animation on enemy collision
- **Project restructure for OOP** - Refactored project directory structure to follow better object-oriented programming practices, making character controllers and state machines more modular and reusable across different entity types

### Technical Progress

- Built enemy lifecycle with Idle, Walk, Stun, and Destroy states in modular state machine
- Implemented bidirectional combat damage system - players can damage enemies AND enemies can damage players
- Learned knockback physics implementation using velocity modification during stun states
- Applied code organization principles to separate reusable components from specific implementations

### Asset Integration

- Downloaded placeholder slime enemy sprites for testing combat system functionality
- Integrated player stun/damage animations with proper timing and visual feedback

### Current Architecture State

- Complete bidirectional combat system with hitbox/hurtbox interactions for both player and enemies
- Modular state machine architecture supporting multiple character types with shared base classes
- Player and enemy damage states with knockback physics and animation integration
- Clean project structure following OOP principles for scalable development
- Foundation ready for health management and UI systems
