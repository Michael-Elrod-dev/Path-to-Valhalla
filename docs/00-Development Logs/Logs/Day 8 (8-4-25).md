### Accomplished Today
- **Implemented player health UI system** - Created visual health bar using placeholder health bar sprite with ProgressBar overlay to display current player health status with real-time updates
- **Integrated health management architecture** - Connected health UI system with existing player damage mechanics, enabling dynamic health bar updates when player takes damage from enemy collisions
- **Established healing system foundation** - Built skeleton framework for player healing mechanics, preparing architecture for future health restoration features like consumables or level-up healing
- **Advanced scene management learning** - Completed [Tutorial Video 12: Scene Management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vterYmcsUCM&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=13) learning automated level instantiation, player spawning systems, and scene transition architecture for multi-level gameplay
### Technical Progress
- Learned ProgressBar UI component integration with sprite overlays for custom health bar visuals
- Applied signal-based communication between damage system and UI components for real-time health updates
- Built modular healing system architecture ready for expansion with different healing sources
- Mastered scene management patterns for automated player instantiation and spawn point configuration across multiple level scenes
### Asset Integration
- Downloaded and integrated placeholder health bar sprite assets for UI development and testing
### Current Architecture State
- Complete health management system with visual feedback and real-time UI updates
- Bidirectional combat system now includes player health tracking and damage visualization
- Modular healing system foundation ready for gameplay feature expansion
- Scene management architecture prepared for multi-level game progression
- Professional UI integration following established signal-based communication patterns
