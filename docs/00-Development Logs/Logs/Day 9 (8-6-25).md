### Accomplished Today

- **Implemented scene transition system** - Completed [Tutorial Video 13: Scene Manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rA-pI06mpw4&list=PLfcCiyd_V9GH8M9xd_QKlyU8jryGcy3Xa&index=14) building comprehensive scene management with automated level transitions triggered by player collision with manually placed transition areas
- **Created smooth transition animations** - Integrated fade-in/fade-out scene transition effects using CanvasLayer and AnimationPlayer, providing professional visual continuity between different game areas and levels
- **Established autoload scene manager architecture** - Built singleton SceneManager system using Godot's autoload functionality for persistent scene state management across level transitions
- **Advanced collision trigger system** - Learned Area2D collision detection for non-physics interactions, specifically for triggering scene changes when player enters designated transition zones

### Technical Progress

- Learned Godot's scene instantiation system for dynamic level loading through script-based scene management
- Applied @tool and @export annotations for editor-friendly scene transition setup with file path exports and range parameters
- Learned engine control techniques including Engine.is_editor_hint(), get_tree().paused, and get_tree().process_frame for smooth transition timing
- Implemented scene re-parenting techniques for maintaining player state continuity across level transitions
- Built variable setter functions for dynamic scene configuration and Local to Scene resource management

### Current Architecture State

- Complete multi-level game progression system with automated scene transitions
- Professional scene transition animations providing smooth visual experience between areas
- Singleton SceneManager autoload system for centralized level management
- Area2D-based trigger system ready for expansion into interactive world elements
- Player state preservation across scene transitions maintaining health, position, and game progress
