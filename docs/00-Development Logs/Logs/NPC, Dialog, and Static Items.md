### Tasks Completed
- Created a rough skeleton system for:
	- NPC characters
	- Dialog interactions
	- Interacting with static items like chests
- Fixed the date bug in the website
- Had a funny idea for Ratatoskr (squirrel form the world tree) to be in the game
- Commissioned two character artists for a sample animation of the main character, should see some results soon
### Resources Used
- None
### Next Session Notes
- All text in the game is blurry. Seems to be a common issue, but I haven't see a working fix yet for pixel games. Maybe blurry is ok if I use pixel text?
- Should start looking for an actual font. Possibly make my own font based on some existing Ancient Norse font
- Maybe look around for free UI assets that I could use or edit for permanent use
- Not sure what to work on next tbh, but hopefully I do something other than play league. What a waste of fucking time that is.
