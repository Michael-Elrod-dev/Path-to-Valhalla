### Tasks Completed
- During the break between now and the last post I built the website for my studio to host projects and stuff
- Debated for quite some time to switch to 3D or even to an isometric 2D design plan
	- Ultimately sticking with 2D
- Screaming, crying and throwing up because some artists I want to hire wont respond
- Added a new state to the player character allowing for a dash action that ignores collision with enemies and the environment
### Resources Used
- None
### Next Session Notes
- Fix the formatting for internal link display in the website's Dev Logs
- Should probably start building out the [[00-Home]] level's mechanics with interactable tables and a portal
- Once this skeleton exists I could build out the different collision areas for different weapon types
