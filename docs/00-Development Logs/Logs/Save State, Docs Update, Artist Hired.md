### Summary
- Added a secret encoding to the save state of the game to prevent users from editing the save file directly
	- Is this even a good decision? The normal player wouldn't even look for the save file. So, should I allow those that would to edit it for fun?
- Filed the forms today to register my studio as a business, Mad King Studio LLC
- Finalized the decision on a character artist/animator and sent them the details for the character design and base weapons to get started, [Francis](https://hybrider-83.carrd.co/)
- Updated the Obsidian environment to integrate Epics and Tasks for better project management
- Also made a huge decision to move the game from 2D to 3D
	- Environment with be made in Blender as a 3D asset and rendering to look 2D inspired by the [T3ssel8r](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERA7-I5nPAU) style
	- Characters will still be 2D sprites either billboarded to the screen or with a fixed camera perspective

### Next Session Notes
- Research how to replicate the 3D pixel art style from various Reddit posts I've saved as well as a collection of YouTube videos
- Use the new Epic/Task setup in Obsidian to start filling out real tasks to be completed
