## HUD Design Philosophy
UI elements that feel authentically Norse and world-integrated, avoiding generic game interface elements that break immersion.

## Core HUD Elements

### Health Display
- **Concept**: Divine favor or life force from the gods
- **Visual**: Glowing runic stones that crack/dim as health decreases (needs work)
- **Placement**: Top-left corner or bottom corners
### Weapon Cooldowns & Ultimate Charge
- **Active Weapons**: God symbols (Thor's hammer, Odin's ravens, etc.) that pulse/glow when ready
- **Ultimate Ability**: Odin's eye or divine light that brightens as ultimate charges
- **Placement**: Bottom of screen, accessible but not intrusive

### Current Powers/Passives
- **Runestones Display**: Stack of runic stones showing active god powers
- **Visual Examples**: Lightning rune for Thor, raven rune for Odin, wolf rune for Tyr
- **Placement**: Right side of screen, always visible for tactical awareness

## World Integration Principles
- **No generic UI elements** - every HUD piece should feel like it belongs in Norse mythology
- **Authentic runic alphabet** (Elder Futhark) for text elements where appropriate
- **God-themed visual language** - each deity's powers have consistent visual identity
- **Atmospheric consistency** - HUD adapts to biome lighting and color schemes

## Technical Considerations
- Scalable for different screen resolutions
- High contrast for combat readability
- Particle effects for divine/magical elements
- Modular system for different god power combinations
