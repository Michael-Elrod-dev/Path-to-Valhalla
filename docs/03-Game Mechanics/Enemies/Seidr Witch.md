### Movement
- Slow moving enemies that have a bit of a limp to them as if they are old
### Weapons
- They cast spells with their staff
### Attacks
- #### Melee
	- At close range they hold their staff straight in the air with both hands and after a brief charge they send out a barrier around them that pushes the player back and damages them. This barrier is yellow
- #### Ranged
	- At range, pointing their staff with one hand they cast a barrage of projectiles that travel very quickly, fire in somewhat random directions within a cone and do not track the player dealing damage on contact. While firing, they do not move but the staff has some kickback like a machine gun firing (Valheim Ice staff)
	- Using the same animation as the barrier attacks, holding the staff straight up with both hands and a brief charge, they place a hex circle under the player which deals damage and stuns the player after a short duration. This hex circle has runic writings in yellow
